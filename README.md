##A Modern Manifesto for Agile Civic Technology##

In the age of civil unrest and racial inequality governments, organizations, and citizens look for new ways to tackle hard social problems, often turning to technology for the answer. However, without a clear assessment and recognition of the prejudices, biases and preconceived notions inherent in that (and every) sector we run the risk of recreating those systemic problems in the technology we create.

This Manifesto is meant to be a living document of practice which outlines some basic principles and beliefs civic technologists might adopt to create more equitable products for the communities that they serve.


This emerged from my work with the [Here4Reenty](http://here4reentry.com) project and the [Morgan State Open Data Symposium](http://www.morganopendata.net).
